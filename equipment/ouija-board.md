### Requirements
For the current ghost to respond, the following requirements must be fulfilled.

- The current player has to be "in a room"
- The ghost must be in a room
- They must not be in the "outside room" (not determined yet)

- the lights in the current room will flicker
- if the setup phase is active, it will cancel and the chance for a hunt will begin
- your insanity will raise by 40
