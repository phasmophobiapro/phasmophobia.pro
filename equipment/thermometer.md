## About
A simple thermometer. Please read more [here](https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Thermometer)

## Updates/Reading
- It updates every ~0.8 seconds
- It has a raycast that will detect the spot temperature within 6 meters

## Glitches
- If you put the thermometer away, and bring it out later it can temporarily read the previous rooms temp prior to updating.
- The current room you're in will only update if you enter the trigger box of a room, it will not reset to another room (this information could be partially invalid, more research is needed into it)

## Temperature Clamps
*The following are the minimum possible temperatures fort the environment, can fluctuate and may not be perfect*
Freezing Ghost: -10째C
Regular Ghost: 5째C

Default Starting Temp: 18째C (this I'm not 100% sure about, it's in there as this but it could be changed)

### Variation
Each time the the thermometer updates there is a random number between -2 and 2 added to the final value. So the minimum for non freezing ghosts can be actually 3째C.
