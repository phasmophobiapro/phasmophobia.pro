## Welcome
Hello and welcome to Phasmophobia Pro, a central location for all the technical data mined from Phasmophobia to help players get a deeper and more technical understanding of the jobs and more. We hope you're doing well. If you need any help and the search function on the site doesn't yield any results, please feel free to reach out on the Phasmophobia Pro Discord server.

#### [Phasmophobia Pro Discord (Ours)](https://discord.gg/C7rXkAQ)
#### [Official Phasmophobia Discord](https://discord.gg/QxvWuqX)

### Who We Are
We're just gamers, and we like Phasmophobia. That's really about it. We're also not members of Kinetic Games, we're just members of the community.

### What P.Pro is
- It's a dumping ground for things we mine, data mining.
- It's a resource to help players understand the game in a deeper way and understand how things interact with each other.
- It can be more in depth technical information now suited for all players.

### What P.Pro is not
- It's not a wiki. If you want a wiki for Phasmophobia please check out the [Phasmophobia Fandom](https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Phasmophobia_Wiki). *Please note, we may provide similar information and even link back to the wiki depending. The wiki has much more general and some information that's more technical.*
- It is **not a cheating/hacking resource**. We do not condone cheating in the game for the purpose of destruction or any other malicious intent. We want to help make the game better, not worse.

### FAQ
#### How do you all find the information?
Through many means, to help discourage malicious users we'll keep how to obtain the information to ourselves.

#### Do you all cheat?
There are many things that can happen during the data mining and tinkering process. Have some of the people involved obtained ways to gain advantages over players? Yes, but we don't actively use them to gain long term advantages which in turn ruin the game and in general discourage the use of anything that could make the game less fun to others or hurt other players.

#### Are you improving or ruining the game?
Uh, grey area. We're providing as much information we can, which to some can ruin the game because they want to find out on their own but to others it helps them enjoy the game because they're not as frustrated with the lack of understanding of the game. So all the information here is optional read and nothing on the website is required to be known to play the game.
