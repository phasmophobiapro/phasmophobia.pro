## About
Phasmophobia uses your local voice to text system to allow you to communicate in game with the entity that's currently haunting the property. The Spirit Box and Ouija Board each have their own phrases they recognize but there's also a list of recognized phrases for the entire game. 

### Note from us
> So far it seems the phrase recognition is pretty solid, it's the [Unity's PhraseRecognitionSystem](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Windows.Speech.PhraseRecognitionSystem.html). I don't personally have experience with it, but it's done pretty well when you speak clearly enough for the text to be translated. Although in the [Phasmophobia official Discord](https://discord.gg/QxvWuqX) it seems there are issues with it at times. There's never any guarantee.
