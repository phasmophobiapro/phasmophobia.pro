## Hunting Timers
*This is only rough estimates, still trying to understand the internals. There is a rotating 25 second timer that switches the hunting states. I believe there's about a 8 25 second rounds where it can't hunt...will continue to look into this*

| Difficulty   | Hunting Time (Seconds)  |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| Amateur      | ~25                     |
| Intermediate | ~35                     |
| Professional | ~50                     |
